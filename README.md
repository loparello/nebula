# Nebula

## About
Nebula is a simple and open source starter kit for Django apps and websites development. 

The idea comes mostly from the necessety to have basic frequently used apps features - like pages or blog - already built in when starting a new project. The other necessity was to make the front-end development in Django apps modern and not relying only on raw CSS abd JavaScript.

The kit comes in fact with handy front-end development tools and commodities like SASS and Vue.js, already configured with Webpack and integrated with Django static files and templates system using [django-webpack-loader](https://github.com/owais/django-webpack-loader).
